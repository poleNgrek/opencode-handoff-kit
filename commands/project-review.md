description: Generate a review artifact for the current branch
subtask: true
---

Loads skills (when available): `review-branch` (Senior Reviewer lens), `discover-knowledge` (Senior Architect lens, used by the knowledge preflight).

Generate a review artifact for the current project.

## Project key resolution

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as `projectKey`. Otherwise auto-detect:

1. Get cwd via `pwd` or workspace root.
2. Scan `~/.config/opencode/projects/*/descriptor.json` files.
3. Match cwd against each descriptor's `projectRootPath`.
4. If exactly one matches, use that `projectKey`. If zero or multiple match, ask the user.

## Review artifact types (plain names; internal letters in parentheses)

Ask the user in **plain language** first; you may show the letter as a shorthand after the name.

| Plain name | Letter | What `REVIEW.md` contains |
|------------|--------|-------------------------|
| **Checklist review** | A | Executive summary, **findings table**, review checklist, how to verify, risks, focus — **no** per-file diff tables. |
| **Diff-first review** | B | Short executive summary + **per-area diff tables** (file / change type / reviewer question). Lighter checklist. |
| **Checklist + diff (full)** | C | Same narrative sections as **Checklist review**, then one **`## Diff summary`** with the **B**-style tables. **Recommend this** for shared or senior review when the branch is non-trivial. |

## Procedure

1. Run refresh internally (call `opencode_refresh_context` or manual refresh steps) to gather: branch, changed_areas, changed_files, risks from `LOG.md`, MR acceptance criteria from `MERGE_REQUEST.md`.

1.5. **Knowledge preflight (silent default).** Run before any user-facing question. Goal: ensure relevant area / leaf `AGENTS.md` files exist and surface stale ones as findings, so the review draws on real context.

   **Knowledge-drift sub-step (committed mode only):** before mapping changed files to leaves, also check whether the branch's `AGENTS.md` set has drifted vs the integration base.

   - Resolve base: `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` → `main` → `master`. Strip the `refs/remotes/origin/` prefix.
   - `git fetch origin <base>` read-only; cache the fetch for **5 minutes per session, fixed** (in-memory timestamp; skip if within window).
   - Compute the drift set: let `MERGE_POINT = git merge-base HEAD origin/<base>`; for every `AGENTS.md` reachable from either `MERGE_POINT` or `origin/<base>`, compare blob ids and collect the differing paths.
   - Skip this sub-step entirely when storage mode is project-local (per [`docs/PATH_CONTRACT.md`](../docs/PATH_CONTRACT.md) § Knowledge across branches).
   - When drift is non-empty, emit one `F-xx` finding (severity `Medium`) "Knowledge drift vs base: <count> file(s)" with Suggested action `Rebase onto origin/<base> or `git checkout origin/<base> -- <path>`; then re-run /project-review`. List each drifted path as bullet evidence on the finding.
   - The drift sub-step is **silent on no drift**.
   - `no-preflight` in `$ARGUMENTS` skips the entire knowledge preflight, including this sub-step.

   1. From the refresh result, take `changed_files` (use `changed_files_preview` if `changed_files` is unavailable).
   2. Load `pseudoPackageDetection` from the descriptor and **normalize**:
      - Object form (legacy v1): wrap in a single-element array.
      - Reject any rule missing `area`.
      - Skip rules whose `pathPattern` lacks `{packageName}` (area-only documentation).
   3. Apply detection rules to map each changed file to a `(area, packageName)` pair. **Disambiguation:** longest matching stem wins; ties broken by descriptor array order. Files that don't map are ignored.
   4. For each unique detected leaf, resolve the expected `AGENTS.md`:
      - If `trackedKnowledgeTargets.sharedPackageKnowledge[packageName]` is defined, use that override path.
      - Otherwise use the convention path `<opencodeProjectRootPath>/<rel>/AGENTS.md`, where `<rel>` mirrors the leaf's path under `projectRootPath` per the **stem derivation contract** in [`docs/PATH_CONTRACT.md`](../docs/PATH_CONTRACT.md).
   5. Apply safety guardrails for any candidate write:
      - Reject leaf names not matching `^[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_-]*$` (`invalid_package_name`).
      - Verify root containment under `opencodeProjectRootPath` (`path_outside_root`).
      - `lstat` the target; if it is a symlink, do not write (`symlink_refused`).
   6. Classify each leaf:
      - **`existing`** — `AGENTS.md` present at resolved path.
      - **`missing`** — no file; safety guardrails passed; auto-scaffold using the leaf template from [`commands/scaffold-knowledge.md`](scaffold-knowledge.md) step 11. **Non-destructive**: skip if the file appeared between detection and write.
      - **`stale`** — file exists and the **deterministic git-based stale heuristic** is true (see below).
      - **`skipped`** — guardrail tripped; record reason.
   7. After each successful auto-scaffold, append exactly one audit line to the active branch's `LOG.md`:

      ```
      preflight: scaffolded <area>/<packageName> at <path> (commit: <head_short>)
      ```
   8. Add convention-path leaf files (existing and newly created) to the review's reread list so step 6 below sees them. Do not re-fetch `reread_files` from the engine — augment the local list.
   9. Emit a structured **`## Preflight summary`** subsection at the very top of the generated `REVIEW.md`, containing:

      ```
      ## Preflight summary
      - created: [<area>/<pkg> -> <path>, ...]
      - existing: <count>
      - stale: [<area>/<pkg>, ...]
      - skipped: [<area>/<pkg> — <reason>, ...]
      - drift_vs_base: [<path/to/AGENTS.md>, ...]   # omit line entirely when drift set is empty
      ```

   For each `stale` entry, also emit one finding `F-xx` "Knowledge stale for `<area>/<package>`" with severity `Medium` and Suggested action `/project-knowledge-refresh <projectKey>`. For each `skipped` entry, emit `F-xx` "Preflight skipped `<area>/<package>` — `<reason>`" with severity `Note`. When `drift_vs_base` is non-empty, emit one `F-xx` "Knowledge drift vs base: <count> file(s)" with severity `Medium` and Suggested action `Rebase onto origin/<base>, or git checkout origin/<base> -- <path>; then re-run /project-review`.

   **Default is silent**: do not interrupt the user with prompts during preflight. Errors surface as findings, not blockers. Users may pass `no-preflight` (in `$ARGUMENTS`, e.g. `/project-review <projectKey> no-preflight`) to skip this step.

   **Stale heuristic (deterministic, git-only):** A leaf's `AGENTS.md` is stale when ALL are true:

   - There is at least one commit since `git merge-base HEAD <baselineBranchForMaterialChanges>` whose changed files include the leaf path (`api/<pkg>/...` or equivalent).
   - There is **no** commit since that merge-base whose changed files include the leaf's `AGENTS.md`.
   - Churn under the leaf since merge-base is `>= 5` changed files OR includes a high-signal sub-path (`gql/`, `models.py`, `migrations/`, `schema.*`, `index.{ts,tsx,js}`, or any file matched by `descriptor.refreshToolHeuristics.highSignalChangedSubstrings`).

   Do **not** use `mtime` — it is unreliable across `git checkout`, IDE saves, and editor scaffolds.

2. **If `REVIEW.md` already exists** in the branch folder:
   - Ask whether to **replace the entire file** or **merge into the existing file** (merge is safer when humans edited triage).
   - If merging or partially regenerating: ask **findings merge mode**:
     - **`preserve` (default)** — keep all existing `## Review findings / questions` table rows and `### Triage checklist (by Id)` lines unchanged unless you are **appending** new findings. Scan existing `F-xx` ids in the file; let `N` be the highest numeric `xx`. New findings get ids `F-(N+01)`, `F-(N+02)`, … (two-digit zero padding). **Never reuse** an existing `F-xx`. Cap **new** rows at 25 per pass; if more risks exist, add one row pointing readers to `## Diff summary` / appendix.
     - **`replace`** — regenerate the findings table from scratch. **Warn:** triage checklists are lost unless the user copied them elsewhere.
3. Ask which artifact type to generate using **plain names** (see table above); default suggestion: **Checklist + diff (C)** for non-trivial branches.
4. Ask whether to include **`## Appendix: change statistics`** (approximate file/churn breakdown and high / medium / low focus tiers). **yes** or **no**.
5. Ask whether to add **additional reviewer context now** (free-text notes from the user, e.g. rollout cautions, known flaky tests, data assumptions, environment caveats). If yes, collect the text and include it in `REVIEW.md` under `## Additional reviewer context`.

5.5. **Mermaid prompt (opt-in).** Per the kit-wide mermaid policy in [`docs/PATH_CONTRACT.md`](../docs/PATH_CONTRACT.md) § Mermaid policy, ask whether to include a single mermaid diagram under an optional `## Architecture` section.

   - **Default:** OFF, unless **structural change** is detected — i.e. any of: new convention-path leaf scaffolded in step 1.5, multi-area diff (≥3 areas in `changed_areas`), schema/route changes (`*.graphql`, `migrations/`, `routes.*`, `schema.*`, `urls.py` in `changed_files`).
   - **Recommendation in prompt:** "Include when structural; skip for typo/test-only changes."
   - **Honor `no-mermaid`** in `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g. `/project-review <projectKey> no-mermaid`) to skip the prompt entirely.
   - **Record the choice** as an HTML comment immediately above the `## Architecture` section (or omit the section): `<!-- mermaid: included on user opt-in -->` or `<!-- mermaid: skipped -->`.
   - **Never** place mermaid inside the `## Review findings / questions` table or any `## OpenCode:` block.

6. Generate the chosen artifact based on actual branch state (not generic templates), merging any user-provided additional context and honoring findings merge mode when `REVIEW.md` existed. If the user opted into mermaid in step 5.5, insert one `## Architecture` section between `## Risks and cross-area concerns` and `## Focus for review`, containing one diagram (component / data-flow / sequence appropriate to the change).
7. Write it to the branch context folder as `REVIEW.md` under **`branchHandoff.contextDirTemplate`** (expand `{projectKey}` and `{branchName}`; default global example: `~/.config/opencode/projects/<projectKey>/branches/<branch-name>/REVIEW.md`).
8. Suggest verification commands the user may want to run (do NOT execute them), using deterministic synthesis:
   - For each changed area, read the area-level `AGENTS.md` and look for `## Verification scripts` table rows matching the schema in [`docs/PATH_CONTRACT.md`](../docs/PATH_CONTRACT.md) (`Trigger | Command | When`).
   - Match each row's `Trigger` against `git diff --name-only` in the review window.
   - Support the qualifier `(added or modified)` on triggers exactly as documented in the schema.
   - Dedupe commands preserving first-seen order.
   - If a changed area lacks a `## Verification scripts` block, emit one `F-xx` finding with severity `Note`: "Missing verification scripts block in `<area>/AGENTS.md`", suggested action `/scaffold-knowledge <projectKey>` (or add the block manually).
   - If no structured rows match, fall back to generic suggestions (`/check-types`, `/run-tests`, `/lint-fix`).

## Output format (MUST use exactly)

```
## Review artifact generated
- project_key: <projectKey>
- branch: <branch-name>
- artifact_type: <checklist|diff_summary|both>
- append_statistics: <yes|no>
- additional_context: <none|included>
- findings_merge_mode: <preserve|replace|n/a>
- findings_count: <N or n/a>
- path: <full path to REVIEW.md>
- suggested_verifications:
  - <command 1 — e.g. bun run lint>
  - <command 2 — e.g. python manage.py test --tag=gql>
  - ...
```

After the structured block, display the generated `REVIEW.md` content inline for immediate readability.

## Default `REVIEW.md` section order (Checklist review and Checklist + diff)

When generating a **checklist** (type A) or the checklist portion of **both** (type C), use this order unless the branch is trivially small (then omit empty sections):

0. **`## Preflight summary`** — emitted by step 1.5 (knowledge preflight). Always present at the very top when preflight ran (skipped only with `no-preflight`).
1. **`## Executive summary`** — 3–8 bullets: what changed, scale of churn (file count / rough insert-delete totals from `git diff` metadata if available), where the highest risk is. For very large MRs, state clearly when most files look like mechanical churn (e.g. import-only refactors) **only** if justified by diff shape; otherwise use cautious language (**estimated**).
2. **`## Review findings / questions`** — triageable engineering questions and risks (not a duplicate of every MR acceptance checkbox). Prefer **questions / risks / follow-ups**; reference MR acceptance by short title where the finding relates to a specific criterion.
   - **Table** (no checkboxes inside cells; pipe table):

     | Id | Severity | Triage | Area | File | Question | Suggested action |
     |----|----------|--------|------|------|----------|------------------|
     | F-01 | High | open | … | path | … | … |

     **Severity:** `Blocker` \| `High` \| `Medium` \| `Low` \| `Note`. **Triage** column: text token `open` until humans edit (optional: `valid` \| `invalid` \| `fixed` \| `wontfix` \| `followup`).
   - **`### Triage checklist (by Id)`** — one line per finding, markdown checkbox, for humans:

     - [ ] F-01 — open

     **Normalization rules (MUST):**
     - Line format is `- [ ] F-xx — <state>` for open or `- [x] F-xx — <state>` for triaged.
     - Allowed `<state>` tokens: `open` | `valid` | `invalid` | `fixed` | `wontfix` | `followup`.
     - If a human edit drops the checkbox marker (for example `- F-01 — valid`), restore it during merge/preserve normalization (`- [x] F-01 — valid`).
     - Do not change the user-authored `<state>` token when normalizing; only restore/normalize the checkbox prefix.
     - Mark checkbox `- [ ]` when `<state>` is `open`; mark `- [x]` when `<state>` is anything else.
     - Never delete existing triage lines during preserve/merge; only append new ids.

   - **`### Findings legend`** — short definitions for severity levels and triage tokens.
   - **Cap:** at most **25** rows in the table for this section; overflow: single row `F-xx` with Question “Additional mechanical / low-signal changes — see `## Diff summary` or appendix” if type C or appendix requested.
3. **`## Review checklist`** — see **Review checklist body** below.
4. **`## How to verify`** — scenario-style steps; `### Frontend` and/or `### Backend` as applicable. See **How to verify** below.
5. **`## Risks and cross-area concerns`** — prefer short bullets that **reference `F-xx`** where possible; avoid duplicating the full findings table.
6. **`## Focus for review`** — short bullet list of highest-value paths (configs, codegen, migrations, public API/schema, files with large non-mechanical diffs, renames). Not an exhaustive file list.
7. **`## Appendix: change statistics`** — **only** if the user chose **yes** in step 4. Include: totals (`git diff --shortstat` style if available), **heuristic** buckets (many tiny deltas vs few large deltas), top files by churn if helpful, and **high / medium / low** focus tiers. Label numbers as **approximate** when not fully verified. Use `git diff --stat` and optionally `--numstat`; flag paths touching configs, lockfiles, `eslint.config.*`, plugin rule sources, migrations, public GraphQL/schema, etc. as **high signal**.
8. **`## Additional reviewer context`** — **only** if the user chose yes in step 5. Place user-supplied notes verbatim (light formatting only) and do not reinterpret factual claims.

## Type C (“Checklist + diff”)

- Emit sections **1–8** from **Default `REVIEW.md` section order** (omit **7** / **8** when the user chose no appendix / no additional context) **once** in full, as for type A.
- Then add a single **`## Diff summary`** heading and produce the type **B** per-area tables below it.
- **Do not** repeat `## How to verify` after the diff block.

## Review checklist body (type A / start of type C)

For **`## Review checklist`**:

- Use markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]`).
- Include all acceptance criteria from `MERGE_REQUEST.md`.
- Add checkboxes for in-scope items and reviewer checks inferred from other MR sections (`Goal`, `In scope`, `Constraints`, `Notes`, `Verification target`).
- Preserve user-added MR details as explicit checklist items where possible.

## How to verify

- Include **scenario-style** verification steps, not only command names.
- If frontend files changed, add **`### Frontend`** with:
  - Optional first line: **`Base URL (manual):`** \<origin from MR, repo `README`, or `ask author` if unknown\>. Do **not** emit a separate global URL section elsewhere in `REVIEW.md`.
  - Mention a **different E2E / Playwright base URL** only when the MR or repo test config explicitly documents one for this branch; otherwise omit.
  - A short **scenario title** (plain line or `**...**` before steps).
  - A line **`Navigate to: <route or path>`** using values from the MR/diff (app-relative path under the manual dev origin, or full path if that is how the team writes MRs).
  - Numbered, task-oriented UI steps (action + expected outcome), ending with a **regression** bullet for an adjacent flow that must remain unchanged.
- **Illustrative excerpt (follow this structure — not literal product copy; derive real routes from the MR):**

```markdown
**Bulk action on list page**

Base URL (manual): http://localhost:5173

Navigate to: /app/feature/items

1. Select several rows using the row checkboxes.
2. Confirm the bulk-action toolbar appears; choose the primary action (e.g. "Create …").
3. Fill the form, including edge cases; submit.
4. Confirm expected records or UI state for each selected row.
5. Regression: open a single item and use the existing single-item flow; confirm it still behaves as before.
```

- If backend files changed, add **`### Backend`** with: suggested test/API commands (listed only, not executed), status codes, DB or contract expectations.
- If only one area changed, include only that area’s subsection(s).

## Populating findings (preserve vs replace)

- **Sources:** MR `Constraints`, `Notes`, `Verification target`, diff hotspots, `LOG.md` risks, mechanical heuristics (config/schema/migrations/lockfiles).
- **Reserve `F-xx` for** questions, risks, and follow-ups — **not** for every acceptance checkbox (those belong in `## Review checklist`).
- **`preserve`:** read existing table and triage list; **append** new rows only for **new** delta since last review; keep prior rows and triage lines intact.
- **`preserve` normalization:** enforce triage checklist checkbox prefixes as `- [ ]` when state is `open`, or `- [x]` for `valid|invalid|fixed|wontfix|followup`; if a line is plain bullet (no checkbox), restore the marker without changing the state token.
- **`replace`:** rebuild table from current branch state; reset triage checklist lines to `- [ ] F-xx — open` for new ids.

## Diff summary format (type B)

When generating **only** a diff summary (type B), still start with a brief **`## Executive summary`** when the change set is large or high-risk; otherwise one short paragraph is enough.

If the user chose **append_statistics: yes**, add **`## Appendix: change statistics`** after the per-area diff tables, using the same appendix rules as in **Default `REVIEW.md` section order** item 7.
If the user provided additional context, add **`## Additional reviewer context`** after the appendix (or after diff tables when appendix is off).

Group by area:

```markdown
### <area-name> (N files changed)

| File | Change type | Reviewer question |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| path/to/file | added/modified/deleted | What should the reviewer check? |

Key concern: <area-specific risk or note>
```

## Constraints

- **Read-only**: NEVER run tests, make code changes, or execute verification commands.
- **Branch-local**: `REVIEW.md` lives in the branch context folder only.
- **Non-destructive**: if `REVIEW.md` already exists, ask user whether to overwrite entirely or merge; when merging, honor **findings merge mode**.
- **Deterministic**: base content on actual git diff and branch files, not assumptions.

## Manual fallback

When tools are unavailable:

1. Resolve branch and branch context folder manually.
2. Read `MERGE_REQUEST.md`, `LOG.md`, and run `git diff --stat` against baseline.
3. If `REVIEW.md` exists, read it and ask for file replace vs merge and findings **preserve** vs **replace**.
4. Ask user for artifact type choice (plain names), appendix statistics yes/no, and additional context yes/no (+ collect text if yes).
5. Generate and write `REVIEW.md` to the branch folder.
